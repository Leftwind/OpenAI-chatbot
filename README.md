# Open AI Chatbot
This program uses the [openAI Api]([url](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) with certain parameters to create a program with PyQt6 as a GUI. 
# Functionality
Little project to showcase my ability to work with AI and API of any kind. Update the system from OpenAI 0.28 to 1.x using the documentation. There are not a lot of changes, but its easy to use.
## How to use
The user needs to enter the program with a Code Inerpreter and Run it. Once that is done he has to submit a message as input and click the _Send Message Button_ or use the _enter Key_. The message will be sone in the chat zone and then a thread will be created. This makes sure the program runs smoothly.

First the message of the user will be shown and then in grey the message of the machine will be shown. This does not happen at the same time because we created a queue of events.
